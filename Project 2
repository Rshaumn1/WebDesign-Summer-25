    <h1><em>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</em></h1><br>
    <p><em>To love someone is to see them as God intended them to be.</em></p><br>
    <p>There is no source material for this quote I don't believe.<br> But I enjoy it because it reminds us to love a person's soul more than anything.</p>

    <title>The Count of Monte Cristo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em></h1>

    <p><em>There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more.<br> He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness</em></p>
    
    <p>I have not yet read The Count of Monte Cristo but it is on my list of books to read. <br>The "classic" literature books interest me because the writing and story telling is thought provoking and philosophical.</p>

<body>
    <h1><em>Frankenstein</em></h1>
    
    <p><em>Beware; for I am fearless and therefore powerful.</em></p>
    
    <p>Another book I have not yet read but is on my list. <br>This one I am excited about the prospects of life and death and right and wrong.<br> I believe this book touches on those subjects.</p>
